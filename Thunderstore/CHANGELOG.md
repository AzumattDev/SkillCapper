| 3.0.0     | - Rewrite a lot of the patches in this mod.<br/> - Changed the name of the configuration file to Azumatt.SkillCapperConfig.yaml<br/> - Internal change to the GUID, this will result in the mod thinking it's different from the original. Make sure you remove the original mod manually if you have it installed.<br/> - `PLEASE REGENERATE ALL CONFIGS AND MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT HAVE THE ORIGINAL MOD INSTALLED!` |
| 2.0.0     | - Major overhaul and rewrite of the mod. Move to yaml configuration so you can add your own skills if needed. `DELETE OLD CONFIG FILE!`<br/>Now can un-cap skills based on the max level you have set in the yaml file. If the value is above 100, they can now level to that and the skills will be rebalanced appropriately.                                                                                       |
